# Seasonal-Traffic-Accident-Analysis

I noticed recently how difficult driving conditions become during the winter, this got me thinking; what is it that makes it so difficult? It seemed that it wasnâ€™t a single factor, but a combination of factors such as low sun and frost, rain and dark, increased traffic when in bad weather. An extension of that thought was to consider whether the causes of accidents vary seasonally and if that is the case is it possible to isolate those factors or combination of factors, ultimately to determine counter measures.

Aside from the real-world application of such an investigation, a more conceptual reason for this analysis was the ability to join multiple datasets through the use of a time and space indicator rather than a traditional unqiue key. Here multiple datasets cover similar times and geographical areas and I was keen to explore whether it was feasible to grow out these features in order to match and combine data.

This repository holds a report and notebook covering my investigations
